__This is a preliminary version of the software for CLEMSite software, granted under an MIT License. If you decide to use this software, read carefully this document and the linked ones (manual).__

The primary goal for this software is to help to automate the process of setup through the acquisition of serial section images coming from a Zeiss FIB-SEM microscope. This process can be performed manually in a single position using the Atlas Engine from Fibics/Zeiss. CLEM*Site* attempts to establish all the conditions previous to the acquisition of the targeted region, monitoring the status of the run and repeat the same process again for multiple positions inside the same biological sample mounted on the stub of the FIB-SEM stage. For this, Atlas Engine is the main conductor of the acquisition process.
